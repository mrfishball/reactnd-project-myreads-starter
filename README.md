# MyReads Project

This is the MyReads project for the Udacity React Nanodegree course. This app allows you to search and add books to shelves of your choice. You can can also move books around shelves after they are added.

The MyReads application is built using React as well as third-party APIs for it's search capability as well as assigning or adding books to different shelves. This means that all the changes you make are persisted with the backend.

## Bugfix

* Fixed where previously no spaces are allowed to be entered in the search field.
* Fixed where search result is blank if one of the book object is missing an imageLinks property. Those books will have a generic book cover image instead.
* Fixed where previously state is directly set to equal to the new object.
* Fixed Book objects in search are not aware of the shelves they are in if they are in one. Moving between shelves from the search result also triggers main page UI rendering.

## TL;DR

* install all project dependencies with `npm install`
* start the application with `npm start`

## Backend Server

The provided file [`BooksAPI.js`](src/BooksAPI.js) contains the methods needed to perform necessary operations on the backend:

* [`getAll`](#getall)
* [`update`](#update)
* [`search`](#search)

### `getAll`

Method Signature:

```js
getAll()
```

* Returns a Promise which resolves to a JSON object containing a collection of book objects.
* This collection represents the books currently in the bookshelves in your app.

### `update`

Method Signature:

```js
update(book, shelf)
```

* book: `<Object>` containing at minimum an `id` attribute
* shelf: `<String>` contains one of ["wantToRead", "currentlyReading", "read"]  
* Returns a Promise which resolves to a JSON object containing the response data of the POST request

### `search`

Method Signature:

```js
search(query, maxResults)
```

* query: `<String>`
* maxResults: `<Integer>` Due to the nature of the backend server, search results are capped at 20, even if this is set higher.
* Returns a Promise which resolves to a JSON object containing a collection of book objects.
* These books do not know which shelf they are on. They are raw results only. You'll need to make sure that books have the correct state while on the search page.

## Important
The backend API uses a fixed set of cached search results and is limited to a particular set of search terms, which can be found in [SEARCH_TERMS.md](SEARCH_TERMS.md). That list of terms are the _only_ terms that will work with the backend, so don't be surprised if your searches for Basket Weaving or Bubble Wrap don't come back with any results.

## Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app). You can find more information on how to perform common tasks [here](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md).
